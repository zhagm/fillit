# Fillit

This program takes a file as parameter which contains a list of Tetriminos and arranges them to create the smallest square possible.

## General Instructions

Clone this repo, run the 'make' command, and run the executable it creates (the executable already exists in the root but make will update it). Pass the executable one of the input files from the 'input_files' directory.

```
./fillit input_files/file
```

To check the result is the expected tetris board, compare with the file of the same name in the output_files
